</h1>

This is a simple website made for school, and it meant to be simple. This website was created using prebuilt webpack template (my private template which I use to create landing pages fast). Of course, I could do more complicated one, but this was not the point here.

# The process

My process of building such simple website is pretty straight forward. This is how it looks like:

1.	First thing I have to have is a sketch. I either create it via an app called Figma or someone provides it to me.
2.	Secondly when the idea is visualized, I have to think of technologies and approaches to create the website.
3.	Then I code, lay the foundation and convert the sketch as good as I can to code.
4.	Lastly are tweaks. This part takes most of the time and can last forever. So, I have to allocate reasonable time for it.
