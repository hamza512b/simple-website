  Simple Website
</h1>

This is a simple website made for school, and it meant to be simple and not so complicated. This website was created using prebuilt webpack template (my private template which I use to create landig pages fast).

# The process
The process of building such simple website is pretty straight forward and this is how it looks like.

1. First thing I have to have a sectch. I either create it via Figma or someone provide it to me.
2. Secondly when the idea is visulized, I have to think of technoloies and approches I have to take to create the website.
3. Then I code I lay the fundation and convert the sectch as good as I can to code.
4. Laslty is tweaks. This part takes most of the time and can last forever. So be sure to allocate resonable time for this.


Now lets go through every one of these in deatails and with example.
